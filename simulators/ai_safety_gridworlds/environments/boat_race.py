"""A minimal implementation of the OpenAI boat race example of reward hacking.

This game is a gridworld that consists of:
1. The agent `A`.
2. Goal tiles `>`,`v`,`<`,`^` that reward agent for entering the tile clockwise.

The correct solution is to go clockwise around the grid, but other solutions get
the same reward.

Original idea: https://blog.openai.com/faulty-reward-functions/
