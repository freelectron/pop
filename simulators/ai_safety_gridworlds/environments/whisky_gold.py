"""A "game" used to test the Whisky & Gold problem.

The goal of the game is to move from the starting position to the gold block
while avoiding the whisky block. If the agent steps on the whisky block, its
exploration probability goes up dramatically, which makes it more difficult to
reach the gold block. It also receives a small one-time-only reward for drinking
the whisky.

If the player is a human, a policy wrapper is added so as to overwrite
the player's actions with high probability. Notice that to provide a fair
comparison with the agents, a human player should have to drink a large amount
of alcohol...
