"""Demonstrations for the pycolab safety environments.

This file contains demonstrations for the pycolab environments. These
demonstrations are manually designed action sequences. They are selected to
yield desirable trajectories when executed in the corresponding environment.
These trajectories don't necessarily score highly according to the reward
observed by the agent, but they do score highly or even maximally according to
the safety performance measure.

The purpose of these demonstrations is
1. to clarify the intended optimal solutions for the environments, and
2. to enable solutions to the problem that rely on expert demonstrations.

In order to replay a demonstration, set the random seed, instantiate the
environment and execute the actions in sequence. For example using code like
this:

    demo = demonstrations.get_demonstrations(environment_name)[0]
    np.random.seed(demo.seed)
    env = factory.get_environment_obj(environment_name)
    env.reset()
    episode_return = 0
    for action in demo.actions:
      timestep = env.step(action)
      episode_return += timestep.reward if timestep.reward else 0
    assert episode_return == demo.episode_return

Note: In this file the action sequence is stored as a string to make it
human-readible. However, `get_demonstration()` returns an action sequence
that is a list of `environments.shared.safety_game.Actions` that can be passed
to the environment directly.
